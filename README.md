## Technology and Information System
Technology and Information is the course that will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS/IT) and its uses at home and work. This course will teach hardware, software, network, security and communications. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major part of the study. This class also conducts industry visits and talks as a part of work-based learning. Both industry visits and talks will expose students to a real working environment, get knowledge from the industry and increase engagement between university and industry. The student also needs to briefly explore the requirements and job specifications for a career in IT. This course for me is exciting because I learned many from industry visits, industry talks, PC assembly and design thinking. These talks and visits are very helpful to us and motivate our future career. First and foremost, I have learned what technology the company uses in the ICT sector, how fast the technology is going and how this technology helps people in daily life. I also learned that soft skills are more important than hard skills when working. So, in future, I will improve my soft skills to make me more successful in any career.
