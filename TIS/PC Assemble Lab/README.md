## Reflection
The PC assemble lab was an insightful experience, allowing me to have a hands-on exploration of hardware components and how to assemble them. This was a good experience for me because we could apply the knowledge learned from the class during the lab. This can let us more detail and understand the hardware of the computer instead of learning in the classroom.
