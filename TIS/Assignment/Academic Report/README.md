## Reflection
I gained knowledge of the six stages of the system development life cycle, which include system analysis, design, development, implementation, and maintenance, in addition to preliminary inquiry. This offers an organized method for creating and sustaining information systems. I also learned a great deal about the particular tools and technology that Credence uses in its system development process. This covers ETL/ELT tools like Airflow and Spark, databases like PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and Druid, and visualization tools like Tableau, PowerBI, Metabase, and Superset. The three most often used programming languages are Python, SQL, and Bash Syntax. I also discovered what abilities are required to work as a data engineer. Python and SQL are emphasized as examples of programming languages that should be learned well. Python's importance in data engineering jobs is demonstrated by the skills gap in the language. ACM Computing Classification System and Data Science Ontology are two examples of ontology engineering methodologies that are mentioned, which highlights the necessity for a deeper comprehension of data-related terminology and real-world objectives in the field. In conclusion, I learned about the stages and procedures involved in system development, the technologies and instruments employed, and the fundamental abilities required of aspiring data engineers, such as fluency in ontology engineering and programming languages.
