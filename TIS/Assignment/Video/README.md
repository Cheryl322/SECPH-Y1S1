## Reflection
I had the opportunity to visit UTM Digital and they gave us a talk about what UTM Digital does and provided us with an enriching and meaningful experience. The sessions included insights into Agile methodology, Scrum framework, and tips for system development. Overall, the talk gave us a good understanding of the digital world, promoting a responsible and human-centric approach to using technology.
