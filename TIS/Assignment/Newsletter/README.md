## Reflection
I learned a lot about current economic trends, procedures, and the practical application of academic knowledge during industry seminars and visits. Engaging with specialists in an industry offers a hands-on knowledge of the field. I was able to fully understand how classroom knowledge may be applied to real-world situations by visiting industrial facilities. Through this visit and lecture, I was able to gain knowledge outside of the classroom and gain a deeper understanding of several topics related to the ICT industry. This has been an incredibly valuable and educational experience for me. In my opinion, I think faculty can conduct more hands-on projects for the student which can enhance their skill. Besides, the faculty can invite some industry experts for the guest lecture to allow the students to gain more industry information and experience from the experts.
