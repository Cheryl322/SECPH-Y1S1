## Reflection
  Design thinking can really impact my study. This is because the emphasis phase in design thinking allows us to clearly understand and define usersâ€™ problems, and develop new prototypes and test solutions for them. In addition, it applies teamwork so that problems can be solved quickly and the quality of solutions can be improved.
  The improvement necessary for me to improve my potential in the industry is to improve my programming skills in SQL, C++, JAVA and more through the short-term course in Coursera and Linkedin. This is because these hard skills are necessary to guarantee my success in the future. Besides, soft skills are necessary to succeed in the future. This is because many technology projects are collaborated among many teams. Collaborating smoothly with others provides a good working atmosphere to produce higher-quality products. So, I will find more opportunities to participate in group projects so that I can improve my soft skills.
